function assert_rename_bijection(renames)
% ASSERT_RENAME_BIJECTION  Guard against a scope-blind rename map giving a false pass.
%   assert_rename_bijection(renames)
%
% Inputs
%   renames  Nx2 cell array, {new_name, old_name}, one row per identifier
% Output
%   none (throws if the map is not a bijection with disjoint domain/range)
%
% The reverse-rename substitution in CHECK_TIER_A is scope-blind: a map with a
% name on both sides (a->b and b->c) can turn an unrelated change into a false
% "isequal" pass. This must hold before that substitution is trusted.
%
% See also CHECK_TIER_A, CANON
